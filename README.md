**Project: SpringShed Boundary Analysis**

This project utilizes Flask, a lightweight WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) web application framework, to build an API for analyzing and processing images. It employs various libraries such as TensorFlow for deep learning-based image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, Pillow for image manipulation, and Pyrebase for Firebase integration.

**Libraries Used:**

**Flask:** A micro web framework for Python.
**Requests:** HTTP library for making requests.
**NumPy:** Library for numerical operations.
**Pillow:** Python Imaging Library for image processing tasks.
**TensorFlow:** An open-source machine learning framework for building and training models.
**Pyrebase4:** Python wrapper for Firebase.
**Gunicorn:** A WSGI HTTP server for running Python applications.

**Endpoints:**

/analyze - Analyzes the provided image URL to calculate various metrics such as total pixels, white pixels, water pixels, and the percentage of water area in the image.
/process_image - Processes the provided image URL by predicting a mask using a pre-trained TensorFlow model. It applies a threshold to the predicted mask to generate a binary mask, which is then saved and stored in Firebase Storage.
Setup:

**Install the required libraries using pip:**

Copy code
pip install flask requests numpy Pillow tensorflow pyrebase4 gunicorn
Set up Firebase:

Create a Firebase project and generate the necessary credentials (serviceAccount.json).
Update the Firebase configuration in the code with your project's details.
Train a TensorFlow model (finasih.h5) or replace it with your pre-trained model.

**Run the Flask application using Gunicorn:**

css
Copy code
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 your_module_name:app
Replace your_module_name with the name of your Python module containing the Flask app.
